## Overview:
This project implemented the **Slow-Pitch Automated Review Calculation (SLOW-ARC)** system, designed to determine whether a specific pitch crosses through the strike zone in a Slow-pitch softball game. Using pitch data files containing coordinates of pitch, player, and home plate, captured from a side view, our system delivers accurate verdicts.

## Key Features:
1) **Automated Verdicts:** The system automatically determines whether a pitch crosses through the strike zone.
2) **Pitch Data Analysis:** Utilizing pitch data files with precise coordinates, the system performs in-depth analysis of pitch tracks and player positions.
